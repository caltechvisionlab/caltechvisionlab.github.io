# Open positions

### Post-Doctoral Researchers

If you are interested in a post-doctoral position in the lab, please send your CV to Caroline Murphy (caroline@caltech.edu).  

We are currently recruiting for a Post-doctoral Fellow to lead the science team in a project titled "Counting migrating salmon in the Pacific Northwest". The goal of the project is to develop and deploy state-of-the-art Computer Vision and Machine Learning system to detect and count every salmon migrating upstream in Pacific Northwest rivers from video. We will be pushing the envelope of what Computer Vision can accomplish in detection, counting and tracking -- the main challenges are domain adaptation and self-supervised learning.  Our goal is both to deliver a working system to count salmon and, more long-term, to develop a general-purpose animal detector and counter, which ecologists and conservationists around the world will want to use for their field studies. The project is led by four PIs: Pietro Perona (Caltech), Georgia Gkioxari (Caltech), Sara Beery (MIT) and Grant van Horn (U. Mass) who collaborate in the broad area of "AI for Ecology and Conservation". The post-doc will develop a technical approach in collaboration with the PIs and co-mentor a team of four graduate students working on the project. The post-doc will also manage a software engineer to help with building the system. The post-doc will also interact with users of the system: NOAA and the Alaska department of Fish and Game to understand how to best deliver the technology to them. The initial appointment is for one year and it is renewable for up to two additional years. To be considered for this position, please indicate "Salmon Project" in your cover letter.



### PhD Students

If you are interested in joining the lab as a PhD student, the first step is to apply for admission to Caltech's PhD program in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.caltech.edu/academics/grad), [Computation and Neural Systems](https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/academics/cns/graduate-studies), [Computer Science](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad_cs), [Computing and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad_cms), or [Control and Dynamical Systems](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad_cds). Application forms and other useful information may be found on [Caltech's graduate admissions page](https://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/admissions). Unfortunately, we are unable to respond individually to all inquiries from prospective graduate students. Instead, please mention the Computational Vision Group or Professor Perona in your statement of purpose.  

### Undergraduate Research Assistants

If you are interested in an undergraduate research position in the lab, please send your CV to Caroline Murphy (caroline@caltech.edu). Our lab members often work with the [SURF](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf), [WAVE](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/wavefellows), and [FSRI](https://diversity.caltech.edu/programs-training/programs/first-year-success-research-institute-fsri) programs.
