# Open positions


### PhD Students

If you are interested in joining the lab as a PhD student, the first step is to apply for admission to Caltech's PhD program in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.caltech.edu/academics/grad), [Computation and Neural Systems](https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/academics/cns/graduate-studies), [Computer Science](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad_cs), [Computing and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad_cms), or [Control and Dynamical Systems](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad_cds). Application forms and other useful information may be found on [Caltech's graduate admissions page](https://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/admissions). Unfortunately, we are unable to respond individually to all inquiries from prospective graduate students. Instead, please mention the Computational Vision Group or Professor Perona in your statement of purpose.  

### Undergraduate Research Assistants

If you are interested in an undergraduate research position in the lab, please send your CV to Caroline Murphy (caroline@caltech.edu). Our lab members often work with the [SURF](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf), [WAVE](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/wavefellows), and [FSRI](https://diversity.caltech.edu/programs-training/programs/first-year-success-research-institute-fsri) programs. We have limited bandwith for SURFS Summer 2026 and will most likely only accept Caltech students. We are unable to reply to applicants individually becauase of the number of applicants.
