                <p align="justify">What are the typical ranges of motion for human arms? What types of leg movements tend to correlate with specific shoulder positions? How can we expect the arms to move given the current body pose? Our goal is to address these questions by recovering a set of ``bases poses'' that summarize the variability of movements in a given collection of static poses captured from images at various viewing angles.</p>
                <div class="cf">
                  <div>
                    <p align="justify">One of the main difficulties of studying human movement is that it is a priori unrestricted, except for physically imposed joint angle limits which have been studied in medical text books, typically for a limited number of configurations. Furthermore, human movement may be distinguished into movemes, actions, and activities depending on structure, complexity, and duration. Movemes refer to the simplest meaningful pattern of motion: a short, target-oriented trajectory, that cannot be further decomposed, e.g. ``reach'', ``grasp'', ``step'', ``kick''.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Extensive studies have been carried out on human action and activity recognition, however little attention has been paid to movemes since human behaviour is difficult to analyze at such a fine scale of dynamics. In this paper, our primary goal is to learn a basis space to smoothly capture movemes from a collection of two dimensional images, although our learned representation can also aid in higher level reasoning.</p>

                <p align="justify">Given a collection of static joint locations from images taken at any angle of view we learn a factorization into a basis pose matrix <b>U</b> and a coefficient matrix <b>V</b>. The learned basis poses <b>U</b> are <i>rotation-invariant</i> and can be globally applied across a range of viewing angles. A sparse linear combination of the learned basis accurately reconstructs the pose of a human involved in an action at any angle of view, also for poses not contained in the training set. In summary, the main contributions of our paper are:</p>

                We analyze the flexibility and usefuleness of the proposed model in a variety of application domains and experiments. In particular, we evaluate (i) the performance of the learned representation for supervised learning tasks such as activity classification; (ii) whether the learned representation captures enough semantics for meaningful manifold traversal and visualization; and (iii) the robustness to initialization and the generalization error. Finally, we provide a qualitative visualization of the embedding of the manifold of human motion that was learned. Collectively, results suggest that our approach is effective at capturing rotation invariant semantics of the underlying data.

                        We show the results obtained from five fold cross validation. The proposed 3-D latent factor model (<i>lfa3d</i>) outperforms all other methods by an average accuracy of about 11%. The 2-D model (<i>lfa2d</i>) performs slightly worse than the clustered SVD baseline (<i>svd+rot</i>), but both show more than a 5% average improvement over the <i>svd</i> baseline.</p>
                        <p align="justify"> The two most challenging activities are <i>athletics</i>, which does not posses characterizing movements; and <i>tennis</i>, whose movemes are shared and thus confused with multiple other sports, <i>badminton</i> and <i>baseball</i> above all.<p>

                        <p align="justify">
                        In this experiment, we shuffled 1000 sequences of four images for four sport actions (<i>baseball pitch</i>, <i>tennis forehand</i>, <i>tennis serve</i>, <i>baseball swing</i>), and verified how precisely could the underlying chronological sequence be recovered. The analysis is repeated five times to obtain standard deviations, and performance is measured in terms of three metrics (shown in the figure): (1) what percentage of the 1000 sequences is exactly reordered; (2) how many poses are wrongly positioned; and (3) how bad are the reordering mistakes, computed as the number of swaps necessary to correct a sequence. We also plot the per-position accuracy in each sport for all methods.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">The <i>lfa3d</i> model has significantly better outcomes compared to <i>lfa2d</i> and <i>svd</i>, which perform similarly. Specifically, <i>lfa3d</i> correctly reorders more than twice the sequences overall (1314 against 555 of <i>lfa2d</i>) averages 1.6 errors, and is the only algorithm to require an average number of swaps smaller than 1.</p>

                           <p align="justify">The most significant movemes contained in the training set are captured by the basis pose matrix <b>U</b> and encoded in the form of a displacement from the mean pose. Each column of <b>U</b> corresponds to a latent factor that describes some of the movement variability present in the data.</p>
                           <p align="justify">We report the motion described by three latent factors: the rows show the pose obtained by adding an increasing portion of the learned moveme (from 30% - second column, to 100% - last column) to the mean pose of the data (first column). Two are easily interpretable, <i>soccer kick</i> and <i>tennis forehand</i>, while one is not as well defined, <i>volleyball strike / tennis serve</i>. The movemes differentiate very quickly, as early as 50% of the final movement is added.</p>

                           <p align="justify">The <i>lfa3d</i> method learns a rotation invariant representation by treating the angle of view of each pose as a variable which is optimized through gradient descent, and requires an initial guess for each training instance. We investigate how sensitive is the model to initialization, and how close is the recovered angle of view to the ground truth.</p>
                            <p align="justify">In the above Figure, we show the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and cosine similarity with ground truth, for three initialization methods: (1) <i>random</i>, between 0 and 2&pi;; (2) <i>coarse</i>, coarsening into discrete buckets (e.g., 4 clusters indicates that we only know the viewing angle quadrant during initalization); and (3) <i>ground-truth</i>.</p>
                         </div>
                         </div>
                         <p align="justify">As the number of clusters increases, we see that performance remains constant for <i>random</i> and <i>ground truth</i>, while both evaluation metrics improve significantly for <i>coarse</i> initialization. For instance, using just four clusters, <i>coarse</i> initialization obtains almost perfect cosine similarity. These results suggest that using very simple heuristics to predict the viewing angle quadrant of a pose is sufficient to obtain optimal performance.</p>

Poses describing similar movements are mapped to nearby positions and form consistent clusters, whose relative distance depends on which latent factors are used to reconstruct the contained poses. Upper body movements are mapped closely in the lower right corner, while lower body movements appear at the opposite end of the embedding. The mapping in the manifold is not affected by the direction each pose is facing, as nearby elements may have very different angle of view, confirming that the learned representation is rotation invariant.</p>

Clearly, the epicentrum of the <i>volleyball strike</i> basis pose is located where volleyball-like poses appear in the t-SNE plot (lower-right corner). Conversly, the <i>soccer kick</i> basis pose is mostly dominant in the top-left area and the heatmap is diffused, consistent with the observation that most poses contain some movement of the legs.</p>
