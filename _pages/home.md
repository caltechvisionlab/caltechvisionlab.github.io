We are interested in the computational foundations of vision. This knowledge helps us design machine vision systems with applications to science, conservation, consumer products, entertainment, manufacturing, and defense. We also study the human visual system using psychophysical experiments and build models of its function. At the moment, we are mostly studying visual recognition: How can we recognize frogs, cell phones, sail boats and many other categories in cluttered pictures? How can we learn these categories in the first place? Can we endow machines with the same ability? Can we create a visual interface to Wikipedia, a [Visipedia](https://visipedia.org/), where pictures are first-class citizens alongside text?
